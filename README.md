**SDM-UniPS**, a groundbreaking, Scalable, Mask-free, and Universal Photometric Stereo technique. Our approach can recover astonishingly intricate surface normal maps, rivaling the quality of 3-D scanners, even when images are captured under unknown, spatially-varying lighting conditions in uncontrolled environments.
